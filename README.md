# JAVA
This sheet convers all the basics of JAVA
## Introduction
    IDE – Integrated Development Environment
    Always use LTS version of Java (Long Term Support)
    Java – To run the application
    Javac – To compile the application
    If I want to experiment with the code in the code line I can use jshell
    Java Playground : jshell
    
    Cmd: jshell
    Now I can write System.out.println("Hello world");
### How Java Works
    Java is independent because of JVM(Java Virtual machine).
    Independent – It can run on any platform
    We have hardware on top of that we have os on that top we have JVM. 
    JVM doesnot accept the code directly it needs bytecode
    The JVM itself is platform dependent. It doesnot work on ios os.
    To convert java code to byte code we need complier. That is Javac.
    I can have 1000 files for a project. Out of all this files only first file is executed.
    The first file needs to have main method.
    The main has a particular signature that is public static void main(String args[]).
    My code is not going to work without this signature.
    Java is object oriented everything should be in class.
    Java Code – .java
    Java Complie code - .class
    JRE(Java Runtime Environment):
    JVM + Libraries is the part of JRE
    All the running of the application takes in JRE
    JDK – Java Development Kit
    JDK contains JRE, JRE contains JVM
